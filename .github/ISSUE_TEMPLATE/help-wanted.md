about: Ask a question if you're having trouble

**What are you trying to do?**
Describe what you want to do in terms of goals.
E.g. I want to count all elements in a vector.

**What have you tried already?**
Reproducible code examples and the output or errors that you get should be included.
It's fine if you just don't know where to start, but have a crack at outlining an approach if you can :)

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the question here.
